We are going to use the  gridfs spec of mongodb to store and retreive the files such as images, audio and video files in the mongodb.
The files will be stored as files and chunk where metadata stored in files and chunks.
reference method used to link the chunck and file using Object_id.
Object_id of file will be refered in the chunk documnent.
